## Guidelines
- All exams are one hour, open book, one page both side handwritten cheat sheet allowed, Cheat sheets need to be submitted with exam scripts. All exams will be out of 100.  
- No questions on source code in exams 
- Project source code must be maintained in Gitlab/GitHub repos 
- If the instructor detects copy-paste in source code or exams then that will result in direct zero for the corresponding project or exam.  
- Projects can be done individually or by in groups. One the group is formed, then create a repo and then add the instructor as a collaborator 
- Each project update will include updates so far as a Markdown file which will reside in the repo. Instructions on how to run the program in the Markdown file. The required libraries needed to run code should be written.  
- Final project report should be spell-checked, typo-free, without passive voice. 
- Class participation will be in forms of giving feedback to peers on project updates. Everyone must be participate in all activities for project update#1, project update#2, and final project. 
- Mismatch between reported output and source code results will be inspected. The instructor will download repos, install libraries, and run the code based on the instruction provided in the mentioned Markdown file. Reported output and source code results will be checked during project update#1, project update#2, and final project submission. For reproducibility teams are allowed to use Docker containers.   
- Every regrade request in due time will be accepted, but all submissions will be re-checked and may result in reduced points. 
- One project report and one project presentation for each group  
- Use the 'Issues' Feature on GitLab to post questions on the course page: https://gitlab.csc.tntech.edu/arahman/csc4220-coursecontent
